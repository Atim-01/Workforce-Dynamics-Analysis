# Workforce_Dynamics_Analysis
## Project Overview
The **Workforce_Dynamics_Analysis** project aims to analyze various factors that influence workforce productivity, work-life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction. This analysis explores trends across different industries, regions, and roles, focusing on the impact of remote work, social isolation, mental health resources, and physical activity on overall employee well-being.

### Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis contains 5000 rows and 20 columns. Each row represents an individual employee's data, and the columns capture a wide range of variables that measure their demographic information, job characteristics, mental and physical well-being, and work environment.
